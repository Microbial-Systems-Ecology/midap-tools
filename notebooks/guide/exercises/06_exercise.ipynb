    "In this exercise, we want to to fine-tune our local neighborhood distance calculation parameters for follow up experiments. The idea is to try out many different distance parameters and see how they influence the correlation between growth rate and density\n",
    "\n",
    "-   for this we calculate the local neighborhood with different distance cutoffs (10,25,50,100,200,400) once with including empty space in the calculation and once without\n",
    "-   we then create a spatial maps plot for each showing coloring by the density (use position 3 at frame 10 as reference plot)\n",
    "-   in addition, we plot an xy correlation of growth rate vs density on data aggregated on the experiment level\n"
