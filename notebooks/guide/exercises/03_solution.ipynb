    "-   you have to start with the already loaded dataset named `exercise_03` (dont reload anything)\n",
    "-   the dataset should have a single color channel with the name `fluoro`\n",
    "-   it should include 4 positions,  pos2, pos3, pos4, pos5\n",
    "-   from pos2 and pos3, the channel CFP should be used for `fluoro`\n",
    "-   from pos4 and pos5 the channel YFP should be used for `fluoro`\n",
    "-   the metadata should have an additional column with the name `fluoro_type` that corresponds to the above details"
