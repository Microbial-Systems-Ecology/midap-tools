    "Problem 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to investigate how well lineages are maintained throughout our experiment. at multiple points, a cell may split. in this case, the trackID will be split into two new trackIDs.\n",
    "However, the lineageID should stay the same for both offsprings.\n",

    "Your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a plot that shows 4 random samples of `area` readout for `lineageID` over time for each position and color_channel\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "We suspect that our data may be subject to bleaching over time, especially because our cells stop growing after 20 frames\n",
    "\n",
    "Your taks:\n",
    "\n",
    "investigate if there is a linear correlation between time and mean_intensity for both groups and both color_channels\n",

    "Problem 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to visually confirm how well the splitting is detected in our tracking data.\n",

    "Your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "use a spatial map on position 6 at frame 10 colored by split. then, create a spatial map one frame later to visually confirm how reliable splits are detected\n"
