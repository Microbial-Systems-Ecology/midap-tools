    "You just received data from a new experiment and after an initial QC visualization you notice a number of issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   you want to create log transforms of area\n",
    "    -   the responding column should be renamed to \"log_size\"\n",
    "-   you want to apply a number of filters to remove problematic data\n",
    "    -   you notice many single occurence trackIDs. you want to filter our any trackID that occurs less than 3 times\n",
    "    -   you notice that some cells are unresonabely short and are probably artefacts. you want to filter out any cell with a `major_axis_length` of less than 20\n",
    "    -   you notice that some cells have very low max intensity values. any cell with a `intensity_max` of less than 0.2 has to be removed\n",
    "    -   you notice that quality sharpyl drops depending on x positions. any `x` coordinate > 100 and < 800 should be filtered out\n",
    "    -   you notice that your data becomes problematic after frame 50. ensure your experiment has data from `frame` 0 to 50\n",
    "-   before you apply the filters, ensure you create a copy of the experiment so you have a before reference\n",
    "-   after you apply the filters, plot a QC histogram for log_size aggregated by experiment\n",
    "-   create the same plot for the copied data without filters\n",
    "-   finally, print out a filter_history\n"
