    "Midap-tools is a toolbox that allows easy loading, visualization and mainpulation of midap output data. \n",

    "Midap-tools comes with a \"small\" example dataset. This dataset is a 1.2 GB download and requires 17.8 GB of disk space when unziped!\n",

    "Download the zip file, put it in a suitable folder and unzip it.\n",
    "**Tip:** all guide documents will work out of the box if you put the zip file into the folder /data and unzip it there. However, midap-tools allows you to load data from anywhere on your computer as long as specify the global path of the folder\n",
