    "midap-tools works on 3 layers\n",
    "1.  your raw data (the basis)\n",
    "2.  the FluidExperiment object (the connector)\n",
    "3.  individual analysis and plotting methods (the analyzer)\n",
    "\n",
    "midap-tools tries rigourously to keep these 3 layers seperate whenever possible. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   midap-tools will never change any raw data. If you load data from a midap output folder you can be sure that it will not overwrite any midap output in the process!\n",
    "-   the FluidExperiment only performs actions to\n",
    "    - load your data and keeps a modified version of it in memory\n",
    "    - match your data to metadata (i.e your grouping)\n",
    "    - pass this data on to analysis or plotting methods and collect the results\n",
    "        - in some cases it offers you the option to reference your own adapted methods\n",
    "    - return or show these results to you\n",
    "-   the individual analysis and plotting methods are designed so:\n",
    "    - each works with a standardized input format (usually a pandas dataframe or a collection of dataframes)\n",
    "    - each returns a standardized output format (usually a modified pandas dataframe or a plot)\n",
    "    - it is easy to create a copy of one and adjust it to your own needs (read Chapter 7 to learn about power user methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if you are interested in the source code, `src/fluid_experiment/fluid_experiment.py` contains all FluidExperiment operations that connect data to operations\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas the folders `src/analysis`, `src/mutate`, `src/plotting` and `src/report` contain all the individual operations to create a single analysis / plot from a simpler input data structure (i.e a pandas DataFrame)"
